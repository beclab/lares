# Chart version fields — the fixed values every chart writes

> **Prerequisite:** read the parent [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md). This collects the fixed version fields every chart writes — `apiVersion: v3`, `olaresManifest.version: '0.12.0'`, and the `olares` system-dependency floor — plus the several distinct "version" fields a chart carries and how they relate.

## Olares system version

The semver scheme (stable / RC / daily), `.Values.sysVersion`, the `-0` prerelease-matching rule, and how to read the target version (`profile list` VERSION column, `--refresh-version`, `settings me version`) are the platform **Olares version & semver model** (loaded via the SKILL.md prerequisite).

## Porting baseline: Olares >= 1.12.6

**This skill (porting apps) targets Olares >= 1.12.6.** This baseline applies only to porting — other `olares-cli` features have no such floor. The reason: the userspace backends a ported app commonly relies on — `drive/Common` (`appCommon`), archive, and NFS — are gated at `1.12.6`. Check the target before porting (`olares-cli profile list` VERSION column; `--refresh-version` or `settings me version` for a live re-fetch).

## apiVersion: v3

Every newly ported chart uses this canonical block. Current `from-compose` writes it directly:

```yaml
apiVersion: v3
olaresManifest.version: '0.12.0'
olaresManifest.type: app
options:
  dependencies:
    - name: olares
      type: system
      version: '>=1.12.6-0'
```

It also writes `workloadReplicas` for every generated Deployment and StatefulSet. If `lint` appears to require `v1`, `v2`, a schema older than `0.12.0`, or an Olares dependency below `1.12.6`, do not downgrade the manifest. Verify that both `olares-cli` and this skill are current, regenerate or restore the canonical block, and lint again.

What `apiVersion: v3` governs (schema only — it does NOT gate admin or namespace):

- **Declarative env rules** — an app-local `envName` must not start with `OLARES_USER`; user/system variables are mapped via `valueFrom`. Full env model: the Env area.
- **Chart scan** — `lint` rejects templates that inline `OLARES_USER...` env names.

A plain v3 app installs into the installing user's `<app>-<owner>` namespace and **any user can install it**. Admin-only install and the shared namespace are opt-in, independent of v3:

- **`options.shared: true`** → cluster-wide singleton in `<app>-shared` (cross-namespace access enabled, owned by the cluster owner) **and** admin-only install. For heavy shared backends (GPU inference servers, shared databases) other apps consume. See the Shared backend pattern.
- **`spec.onlyAdmin: true`** → admin-only install with no shared namespace; for an app that manages its own users internally.

## The version fields in a chart (don't confuse them)

A chart carries several "version" fields with different jobs. Their values are fixed for every app:

| Field | Where | What it is | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | `OlaresManifest.yaml` (top level) | manifest API generation | `v3` |
| `olaresManifest.version` | `OlaresManifest.yaml` | manifest schema | `0.12.0` |
| `metadata.version` | `OlaresManifest.yaml` | **Chart version** (Market package) | semver, **equal `Chart.yaml` `version`** |
| `version` | `Chart.yaml` | Helm chart version | `== metadata.version` |
| `spec.versionName` | `OlaresManifest.yaml` | **upstream app** version (display) | tracks `Chart.yaml` `appVersion` — convention, not enforced |

> **Bump after a material change:** raise `metadata.version` (= `Chart.yaml` `version`, kept equal) after changing the chart, manifest, or image — a patch bump (e.g. `0.0.1 → 0.0.2`) by default. Do not bump solely to retry an architecture rejection or transient node-discovery failure; unchanged bytes cannot fix either condition. See the Deploy step §2.

> **Name clash:** `Chart.yaml apiVersion: v2` is Helm's chart API. It is separate from `OlaresManifest.yaml apiVersion: v3`; both values are correct and neither should be copied over the other.

### olaresManifest.version: 0.12.0

`0.12.0` is the manifest schema every chart uses (`from-compose` emits it). It defines:

- **Resource envelope**, in one of two mutually-exclusive shapes: a non-accelerator app uses the flat `spec.requiredCpu` / `limitedCpu` / `requiredMemory` / `limitedMemory` / `requiredDisk` (no `mode`); a GPU/accelerator app uses the mode-keyed `spec.accelerator[]` (`cpu`, `nvidia`, ...). `lint` error messages call `spec.accelerator` **`spec.resources`** — that is just an alias in the message, not a separate field.
- **GPU / accelerator** declared via `spec.accelerator` with a mode → arch cross-check at `lint`.
- **`permission.externalData`** (`.Values.sharedlib`).
- **`workloadReplicas`** — a required map of every Deployment/StatefulSet → replica count, with each workload's `spec.replicas` wired to `{{ .Values.workloads.<name>.replicaCount }}`. See the Manifest refinement areas (Workloads & replicas).

Accelerator mode declaration and sizing are in the Accelerator sizing.

## System dependency: the constraint

Every chart declares the `olares` `type: system` dependency in `options.dependencies` — the entry's shape and the "author it yourself" rule are in the Manifest refinement areas (System dependency: olares). What this section adds is the **constraint semantics**:

- At install, app-service matches the version constraint against the running Olares version (semver); a mismatch blocks install.
- Declare exactly `>=1.12.6-0`. The `-0` prerelease suffix is required so daily/RC builds (e.g. `1.12.6-20260327`) match — without it they fail to match an otherwise-satisfied version.

`lint` requires both this entry and `workloadReplicas` to be present.

## Caveats

- The `>= 1.12.6` baseline is a **porting** concern; it does not apply to other `olares-cli` commands.
- `profile list`'s version is **cached** — use `--refresh-version` (or `settings me version`) if the target was just upgraded.
