# Environment variables — system / user / app level

> **Prerequisite:** read the parent [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md). Env wiring is the configuration that accompanies the §3 Middleware & dependencies area of the Manifest refinement areas (middleware values are its sibling).

Olares exposes configuration to an app through env vars at **three levels**. The app declares only the app-level ones (in `OlaresManifest.yaml` `envs[]`); the other two are platform-managed and consumed by reference.

| Level | Names | Who owns / sets it | Scope | App access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **System** | `OLARES_SYSTEM_*` | installer / admin, cluster-wide | shared by all users | read-only, via `valueFrom` |
| **User** | `OLARES_USER_*` | each user (SMTP, API keys, tokens) | per-user, isolated | read-only, via `valueFrom` |
| **App** | any app-local name in `envs[]` | the chart author | this app install | declared directly; surfaced as `.Values.olaresEnv.<name>` |

> **Nothing is auto-injected into the container.** Declaring an env (or referencing a system/user var) only puts the value into `.Values.olaresEnv.<name>`. You MUST map it into the workload yourself:
>
> ```yaml
> env:
>   - name: APP_SITE_TITLE
>     value: "{{ .Values.olaresEnv.APP_SITE_TITLE }}"
> ```
>
> A credential is mapped the same way in principle, but travels through a Secret instead of a literal value ([secrets.md](olares-chart-secrets.md)).
>
> This is different from system-injected Helm values like `.Values.postgres.*` / `.Values.userspace.*` / `.Values.os.*` (full catalogue in the system-injected Helm values reference) — those are not env vars and also need explicit mapping.

## When to declare an app-level env

| Scenario | How |
|---|---|
| User must supply a value at install (admin username/password, license key, an API key not covered by a user var) | `required: true` (+ `type: password` for secrets). With no `default`, Olares prompts the user during install. |
| One of a fixed set of choices | `options` (inline dropdown) or `remoteOptions` (list fetched from a URL) |
| Reuse an Olares-managed value (CDN, Hugging Face token/endpoint, SMTP, OpenAI/Anthropic key, GitHub token) | `valueFrom.envName: OLARES_SYSTEM_* / OLARES_USER_*` — don't re-ask the user for something Olares already holds |
| Value should be changeable after install | `editable: true` (add `applyOnChange: true` to restart consumers automatically) |
| Static config that never varies per install | bake it into the image or template — do **not** make it an env |

The classic case — **initialize an app's admin username and password** — is an app-level env with `required: true` and no `default`, so the user is forced to enter them on the install screen.

## Declaration fields

Each entry under `envs:` supports these fields ([app-env-vars.md](https://docs.olares.com/developer/develop/app-env-vars.html)):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `envName` | App-local name; injected as `.Values.olaresEnv.<envName>`. **Must not start with `OLARES_USER`** — this is enforced because the skill sets `apiVersion: v3` (see the Version & deps fields). Map user vars via `valueFrom` instead. |
| `default` | Developer-supplied fallback. Users cannot edit it. Used when no user value and no `valueFrom`. |
| `valueFrom.envName` | Map to a system/user variable. The entry then **inherits** `type` / `editable` / `regex` / etc. from the referenced var; local `default` / `options` / `type` are ignored. |
| `required` | `true` → must resolve to a non-empty value for install to proceed (see below). |
| `editable` | `true` → value can be changed after install. |
| `applyOnChange` | `true` → changing it auto-restarts apps/components that use it; `false` → takes effect only on upgrade/reinstall. |
| `type` | Value format for validation (see below). |
| `regex` | Regular expression the value must match. |
| `options` | Inline fixed list (`{title, value}`) → selection UI. |
| `remoteOptions` | URL returning a JSON array in the same shape as `options`. |
| `description` | Human-readable purpose shown in the UI. |

## Validation semantics

How `required`, `type`, and `regex` actually behave at install:

### required vs optional — two code paths

- **Plain var (no `valueFrom`):** the effective value is `value || default`.
  - `required: true` and effective value is empty → reported as **`missingValues`**; install is blocked and the UI prompts the user (this is the init username/password case).
  - `required: false` (default) → empty is allowed; install proceeds.
- **Mapped var (`valueFrom`):**
  - `required: true` → app-service lists `SystemEnv` and the owner's `UserEnv`, and checks the referenced name is **present and non-empty**; otherwise reported as **`missingRefs`**.
  - optional `valueFrom` → **not** existence-checked; an empty reference resolves to empty.

> `required` with no `default` prompts the user at install, and after install the value **cannot be set back to empty**.

### Field types (`type`)

`int` | `bool` | `url` | `ip` | `domain` | `email` | `string` | `password`. `password` is rendered masked in the UI. The type is used to format-validate the value before it is accepted. Declare it for every credential the user supplies, and hand the value to the container through a Secret — see [secrets.md](olares-chart-secrets.md).

### Choice types

`options` (inline) and `remoteOptions` (fetched from a URL) restrict the value to a fixed list and present a selection UI instead of free text.

### regex

The value must match `regex`; this is checked by `ValidateValue(effectiveValue)`, and a failure is reported as **`invalidValues`**. `type` and `regex` **stack** — e.g. a username can be `type: string` plus `regex: '^[a-z0-9]{3,20}$'`. Validation runs on the resolved value, so for an optional var that may be left empty, pair a strict `regex`/`type` with a `default` (or make it `required`) to avoid surprising empty-value behavior.

### How failures surface

App-service does **not** return a 5xx. It returns HTTP 200 with an embedded `code: 422` and payload `type: appenv`, split into three buckets:

```json
{
  "code": 422,
  "data": {
    "type": "appenv",
    "data": {
      "missingValues": [ /* required + empty */ ],
      "missingRefs":   [ /* required valueFrom, referenced var missing/empty */ ],
      "invalidValues": [ /* type/regex/options validation failed */ ]
    }
  }
}
```

The CLI renders these (e.g. as "missing required env var(s): …"). **`lint` does not check any of this** — it neither validates env values nor verifies that the template actually maps `.Values.olaresEnv.<name>` into a container `env:`. Only app-service validates, at install time.

### required / type / regex at a glance

| Declaration | Outcome at install |
|---|---|
| `required: true`, no `default`, no `valueFrom` | user is prompted; empty → `missingValues` |
| `required: true`, has `default` | `default` used if user leaves it; never empty |
| `required: true`, `valueFrom` → var unset/empty | `missingRefs` |
| `required: false`, no `default` | allowed empty; install proceeds |
| any, value fails `type`/`regex`/`options` | `invalidValues` |

## Worked examples & default variables

Copy-pasteable examples (init admin credentials, reuse a user var, optional-with-default) and the full list of default `OLARES_SYSTEM_*` / `OLARES_USER_*` variables you can map via `valueFrom` are in the Env worked-examples reference.

## Caveats

- **Map it in the template.** `.Values.olaresEnv.<name>` does not reach the container until you write it into `env:`.
- **`lint` won't catch env mistakes.** Missing mappings, wrong `valueFrom` names, and bad values are only caught by app-service at install (the `appenv` 422 above).
- **`valueFrom` inherits** `type`/`editable`/`regex` from the referenced var; local `default`/`options`/`type` are ignored.
- **Install-time override.** A value can be supplied at install via the CLI `--env KEY=VALUE` (see [`olares-market`](../../olares-market/SKILL.md)).
- **`applyOnChange: false`** means edits only take effect on upgrade/reinstall — stopping and starting the app does nothing.
- **Helm renders unset optional env vars as empty strings.** When a user hasn't filled in an optional env (`required: false`, no `default`) and the template contains `value: "{{ .Values.olaresEnv.FOO }}"`, Helm renders this as `value: ""` — an empty string, not an absent env var. Apps that treat these as URLs (e.g. an HF endpoint, a proxy address) will receive `""` and fail with "missing protocol" or similar errors. Guard at app startup: unset any env var whose value is an empty string before the library reads it. Example (Python):
  ```python
  for var in ("HF_ENDPOINT", "HF_TOKEN"):
      if not os.environ.get(var, "").strip():
          os.environ.pop(var, None)
  ```
  This `""` behavior applies only to a key **declared in `envs[]`** (so it exists in `.Values.olaresEnv`). A reference to a key that is *not declared at all* renders as `<no value>` instead — a different failure mode — so keep every env you template referenced in `envs[]`.

## Kubernetes service-link env collision (default `enableServiceLinks: false`)

Kubernetes injects, into every container, an env var per same-namespace Service that predates the pod (a Docker `--link` legacy). The biting one is Docker-link style — a Service named `psitransfer` yields `PSITRANSFER_PORT=tcp://10.233.4.38:3000` (plus `*_SERVICE_HOST` / `*_SERVICE_PORT` / `*_PORT_<n>_TCP*`; service name upper-cased, `-`→`_`).

**The trap:** when that upper-cased Service name is also the prefix an app uses for its own config, the injected `<SVC>_PORT=tcp://...` silently clobbers it. Real case: psitransfer reads `PSITRANSFER_PORT` as its listen port → `parseInt("tcp://...")` = `NaN` → never binds → the container **exits 0 with empty logs** (looks like a mysterious crashloop).

Default to `enableServiceLinks: false` on the pod template:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      enableServiceLinks: false
```

DNS discovery (`<svc>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local`) and the always-present `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_*` are unaffected — you only drop the legacy injection modern apps don't use. To debug a suspected hit, `olares-cli cluster container env <ns>/<pod>/<container> | grep <APPNAME>` for a `*_PORT=tcp://...`; alternatively declare the colliding var explicitly in `env:` (explicit wins).
