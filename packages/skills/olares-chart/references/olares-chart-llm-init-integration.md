# Integrate `llm-init` into a custom chart

> **Prerequisite:** read the parent [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) first. Choose this route only when the chart itself embeds `llm-init` as a serving sidecar or model downloader. Official generation clones use [llm-models.md](olares-chart-llm-models.md); embeddings use `olares-cli market install embeddinggemmav3` through [`olares-market`](../../olares-market/SKILL.md).

## Chart-author recipe

1. Add a pinned `beclab/llm-init` container to the chart.
2. Set `MODEL_NAME`, `MODEL_MODE`, and `MODEL_SOURCE`. Add optional raw `supports_*` values through `MODEL_SUPPORTS`.
3. For serving, set `ENGINE_KIND` to the chosen engine and give the engine container the same `ENGINE_ARGS`. Leave `ENGINE_KIND` empty only when the chart needs download-only behavior.
4. Mount the App Common Hugging Face cache at `/cache/hf/hub` and a per-pod run-state volume at `/run/llm-init`. Ensure UID 1000 can write both.
5. Make the consumer wait until `GET /readyz` succeeds or until the supported `/run/llm-init/model_path` sentinel is present, then read the resolved path.
6. Use the upstream `llm-init` documentation for the complete environment, source, engine, and API contract.

The four official generation charts expose convenience groups for `MODEL_SUPPORTS`: `vision`, `tools`, `thinking`, and `none`. Raw `llm-init` does not expand those groups. Its optional `MODEL_SUPPORTS` value is a comma-separated list of validated `supports_*` keys, such as `supports_reasoning,supports_tool_choice`; an unknown key fails startup.

## Serving and download-only

A serving chart sets `ENGINE_KIND` to `llamacpp`, `ollama`, `vllm`, or `sglang`, shares model storage with the matching engine container, and routes consumers through the `llm-init` data plane.

A download-only chart leaves `ENGINE_KIND` empty. `llm-init` downloads the model, maintains its control plane, and exposes no `/v1/*` data plane. In this mode:

- `hf://owner/repo` downloads into the shared Hugging Face cache;
- `https://...` downloads to the explicit `MODEL_SOURCE_LOCAL` path;
- `ollama://...` is not supported because no Ollama serving engine is present.

Example download-only configuration:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MODEL_NAME
    value: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
  - name: MODEL_MODE
    value: chat
  - name: MODEL_SOURCE
    value: hf://Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
  - name: ENGINE_KIND
    value: ""
```

## Sources and credentials

Use one source form for a simple chart:

```text
MODEL_SOURCE=hf://Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
MODEL_SOURCE=https://models.example/model.gguf
MODEL_SOURCE_LOCAL=/cache/manual/model.gguf
```

Raw integration also supports comma-separated sources and 1-based indexed sources. These are chart-author features: choose one form, keep exactly one main source, and mount every explicit local destination. In comma form, the first source is the main source and every later source is an extra download.

```text
MODEL_SOURCE=hf://org/main,hf://org/extra
```

```text
MODEL_SOURCE_NUM=2
MODEL_SOURCE_1=hf://org/main
MODEL_SOURCE_1_ROLE=main
MODEL_SOURCE_2=https://models.example/extra.bin
MODEL_SOURCE_2_LOCAL=/cache/manual/extra.bin
MODEL_SOURCE_2_ROLE=extra
```

For every `hf://` source, set deployment-level `HF_ENDPOINT` and `HF_TOKEN` as needed. Map them from the Olares Hugging Face user values described in [the chart environment reference](olares-chart-env.md), rather than placing credentials or mirror flags inside `MODEL_SOURCE`.

Mount `.Values.userspace.appCommon` with `permission.appCommon: true` so `/cache/hf/hub` is shared across applications. The cache and `/run/llm-init` run-state volume must preserve POSIX rename behavior and be writable by UID 1000. The engine or consumer should mount downloaded model data read-only when it does not need to modify it.
