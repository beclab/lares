# Refining OlaresManifest.yaml — the four refinement areas

> **Prerequisite:** read the parent [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) first.
> This is the field-by-field map from a raw `from-compose` stub to a working chart. After every change, re-run `olares-cli chart lint ./<app>` (see the Validate-local (lint) step).

The scaffolded manifest is a stub. This doc covers, in order: the fixed **header fields**, the **two required manifest entries** every chart must author (`workloadReplicas` and the `olares` system dependency — `lint` rejects either if missing), then the **four refinement areas** kompose cannot decide (§1 Metadata can stay a stub for deploying to your Olares; §2–§4 are functional and always required). Full market-ready metadata is only for publishing — see [`../../olares-publish/SKILL.md`](../../olares-publish/SKILL.md).

## Header fields

The manifest top sets `apiVersion: v3` and `olaresManifest.version: '0.12.0'`. `0.12.0` carries `spec.accelerator` and `permission.externalData`. The fixed version-field values, the `olares` system dependency, and the field map are in the Version & deps fields; accelerator modes & sizing are in the Accelerator sizing.
## OlaresManifest skeleton (top-level keys)

Top-level keys, in canonical order, **all siblings at column 0** (field detail is in the linked sections): `olaresManifest.version` · `olaresManifest.type` · `apiVersion` · `metadata` (§1) · `entrances` (§4) · `spec` (§1 + resources/accelerator) · `permission` (§2, only areas you mount) · `middleware` (§3, only if wiring system middleware) · `options` (olares system dep + middleware/app deps) · `workloadReplicas` (**required; sibling of spec, not nested under it**) · optional/niche: `ports` / `envs` / `overlayGateway` / `tailscale`.

## Workloads & replicas (required)

Every chart **must** declare a top-level `workloadReplicas` map — one entry per **Deployment / StatefulSet** the chart renders → its replica count. **This is a mandatory part of authoring the chart, and it is on you to get right: declare it and confirm it yourself for every chart, whether you scaffolded with `from-compose` or hand-authored, and re-check it whenever you add, rename, or remove a workload. Do not assume a scaffolder produced it correctly, and do not treat a passing `lint` as proof it is present and wired** — `lint` rejecting an omitted map is a backstop, not the reason you write it.

```yaml
workloadReplicas:
  myapp: 1          # every Deployment/StatefulSet name must appear here
  worker: 1
```

**Self-check (inspect the files directly — do not rely on any tool):**

1. `OlaresManifest.yaml` top-level `workloadReplicas` lists **every** Deployment/StatefulSet the chart renders (by rendered `metadata.name`) → its replica count. **DaemonSets are excluded** (one-per-node, not replica-controlled).
2. Every listed workload's template sets `spec.replicas: {{ .Values.workloads.<name>.replicaCount }}` — **never a hardcoded number**. If the workload name contains a dash, write `spec.replicas: {{ (index .Values.workloads "<name>").replicaCount }}` instead; Helm's dotted syntax cannot reach a dashed key and the chart fails to render. This `spec.replicas` is the Deployment/StatefulSet **template's** spec under `templates/`, a different field from the manifest's top-level `spec` — don't conflate the two.
3. `values.yaml` carries a matching `workloads.<name>.replicaCount` for each. The `.Values.workloads.*` value is documented in the system-injected Helm values reference.

**Why the template wiring matters (non-obvious).** app-service drives the whole lifecycle through this Helm value: install is two-phase (helm renders at `replicas: 0`, then scales up), suspend scales every listed workload to `0`, resume scales back to the declared counts. If a template **hardcodes** `replicas`, **suspend/resume and the staged install silently stop working** — the value override has nothing to drive.

## System dependency: olares (required)

Every chart **must** declare the `olares` system dependency in `options.dependencies` — author it yourself, under the same "don't assume the scaffolder added it, don't treat a passing `lint` as proof" rule as `workloadReplicas` above.

```yaml
options:
  dependencies:
  - name: olares
    version: '>=1.12.6-0'   # -0 covers daily/prerelease builds
    type: system
```

The constraint and the `-0` prerelease rule are in the Version & deps fields.

## 1. Metadata

For deploying to your own Olares, metadata can stay a stub as long as `lint` passes. Full market-ready metadata (custom icon, dual-version categories, listing images, marketing spec) is only needed when **publishing to the public Market** — see [`../../olares-publish/SKILL.md`](../../olares-publish/SKILL.md).

### Always required (`lint` structural check)

```yaml
metadata:
  name: myapp                 # must match folder + Chart.yaml name; do not change casually
  appid: myapp                # app identifier; set = name. from-compose scaffolds it
  title: My App               # stub title=name is OK for local deploy
  description: One-line summary
  icon: https://app.cdn.olares.com/appstore/default/defaulticon.webp  # default OK for local deploy
  version: 0.0.1              # Chart Version — MUST equal Chart.yaml `version`; bump on each (re)upload
  categories:
  - Utilities                 # stub OK for local deploy; lint does not enum-check
spec:
  versionName: "1.2.3"        # upstream app version; tracks Chart.yaml `appVersion`
  runAsUser: true             # optional but recommended — Olares injects pod runAsUser 1000; see the run identity (uid 1000) guidance
```

> **Resource envelope (optional, under `spec`):** a non-accelerator app sets flat `spec.requiredCpu` / `limitedCpu` / `requiredMemory` / `limitedMemory` / `requiredDisk` (no `mode`); a GPU/accelerator app uses `spec.accelerator[]` instead — the two are mutually exclusive. See the Accelerator sizing §A.1.

> **`appid` vs `lint`:** `chart lint` only requires `name`, `icon`, `description`, `title`, `version` (`appid` is `omitempty` in the schema, so a chart lints without it). **Keep `appid` present and equal to `metadata.name`** when hand-authoring a manifest (e.g. from a generic Helm chart); rename it alongside `name` / the folder / `Chart.yaml`. **`lint` passes without it; `market upload` does not** — omitting it produces `upload payload missing ... metadata.appid`. It does not decide the entrance host, which the platform derives from the app name — see the system-injected Helm values reference.

### Keep as stub (deploy to your Olares)

Keep the stub: `Utilities` category, default icon, and empty `spec.developer`/`submitter`/`website`/`sourceCode`/`fullDescription`/`featuredImage`/`promoteImage`/`locale` are all fine. Optional polish: set `metadata.title`/`description` to something readable and `spec.versionName` to the upstream version.

**`spec.supportArch` is not part of the stub** — `lint` requires it and rejects an empty list, so it must name the arch you actually built (one entry for a local deploy). See the Image capability.

## 2. Storage (compose volumes → Olares userspace)

Each compose volume became a raw `persistentvolumeclaim-*.yaml`. Map each to a userspace area, **delete the PVC template you replace**, and rewrite `volumeMounts` to the injected userspace path. The five areas — their mount values, `permission` fields, backends (JuiceFS vs node-local PV), scope, uid-1000 ownership, and version gates — are defined once in the platform **Userspace storage model** (loaded via the SKILL.md prerequisite). **Pick by need:** private db/config → **Data** (`appData`); regenerable cache → **Cache** (`appCache`); user-facing files → **Home** (`userData`); multi-app shared model weights / HF cache → **Common** (`appCommon`, see the GPU / models capability §B); external disk/network share → **External** (`sharedlib`).

```yaml
permission:
  appData: true
  appCache: true
  appCommon: true             # shared Common dir; cross-app model/cache sharing
  userData:
  - Home/Documents/MyApp/
```

In the deployment template, replace the PVC mount with the injected host path (`appData`/`appCache` are host paths):

```yaml
      volumes:
      - name: app-data
        hostPath:
          path: {{ .Values.userspace.appData }}
          type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

> The injected value already ends in the app's own name, so appending it again
> lands the data one level deeper than intended. Add a subdirectory only to
> organize *within* the app's area.

> Anything declared in a template (`.Values.userspace.appData/appCache/userData`) MUST have the matching `permission` field, or `lint`'s app-data cross-check fails. Drop leftover kompose PVCs.

> **Coupling with packaging — run identity:** userspace mounts require the process to run as **uid 1000** (set `spec.runAsUser: true`). For third-party or root-default images, or a hardcoded write path Olares won't grant, see the run identity (uid 1000) guidance and the Image capability.

## 3. Middleware & dependencies

Replace any bundled `postgres`/`redis`/`mongodb`/`mysql`/`mariadb`/`minio`/`rabbitmq`/`nats` workload with Olares **system middleware**, prefer Postgres over a bundled SQLite, and depend on an already-ported companion app instead of copying its workload. `lint` does **not** flag a bundled db, so this is on you. Full rules — the SQLite→Postgres decision, the `middleware:` block, the PostgreSQL extension catalog, `type: application` dependencies, and the self-hosted escape hatch — are in the Middleware & dependencies area. Env wiring of the `.Values.<mw>.*` values is in the Env area.

> The `olares` `type: system` dependency (see "System dependency: olares") is a **separate, always-required** entry in `options.dependencies` — keep it when you add or remove middleware / application dependencies.

## 4. Entrances & ports

The stub has one auto-detected entrance. Adjust:

```yaml
entrances:
- name: myapp
  host: myapp-svc        # an existing Service name in templates/
  port: 8080             # the Service port
  title: My App
  authLevel: private     # public | private | internal
  invisible: false       # true for internal-only services
```

- **One entrance per user-facing HTTP service.** Add entries for additional UIs; set `invisible: true` (or omit the entrance) for internal-only services.
- **No web UI at all** (a CLI tool, an MCP server, an API daemon)? Don't force a fake entrance — apply the headless archetype: a web terminal as the visible entrance + the service port as an invisible internal entrance (the headless archetype).
- **Non-HTTP services** (game server, SMTP, RDP, …) are exposed via `ports[]`, not entrances:
  ```yaml
  ports:
  - name: game
    host: game-svc
    port: 7777
    protocol: udp
    exposePort: 47777    # cluster-unique; avoid reserved 22/80/81/443/444/2379/18088
  ```
- **Outbound non-HTTP** (e.g. the app sends SMTP): `options.allowedOutboundPorts: [465, 587]`.
- **Long-running HTTP requests** (LLM streaming, big uploads, slow report generation): the per-app **entrance proxy** caps every request at `options.apiTimeout` **seconds** — **default 15s**, so anything slower is cut at the entrance (504 / closed connection) regardless of the app or browser. Set `options.apiTimeout: 0` to disable the cap, or a large value (e.g. `3600`) for a bounded one. **Only `0` disables it** — a *negative* value is not "no timeout"; the sidecar treats it (like an unset field) as the 15s default. It is an install-time **manifest** field (not an install-time env), so for `templateOnly` env-driven charts you must edit it in the chart manifest and re-package.

## After refining

Re-run `olares-cli chart lint ./myapp` (loop back here on any failure). Once `lint` passes, **deploy to your Olares** — the Deploy step. To list it on the public Market, see [`../../olares-publish/SKILL.md`](../../olares-publish/SKILL.md).
